# Runs for the lifetime of an interactive session. Every line it prints becomes
# a notification in that session, which is the only channel that reaches an
# agent sitting idle at the prompt — hooks fire only when the agent is already
# doing something. `concord inbox drain` prints nothing on an empty inbox, so a
# quiet workspace stays quiet.

# Identity needs no configuration: Claude Code exports CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID

# to do with Concord. Exit immediately rather than leaving a poll loop spawning
# a subprocess every couple of seconds for the life of an unrelated project.
